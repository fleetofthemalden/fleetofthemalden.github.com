<h2>Web Projects</h2>


<p>
<a href="http://fleetofthemalden.com">fleetofthemalden.com</a><br />
A training tool intended primarily for rowers on the Tufts Varsity Crew Team, allowing access to various erg workouts, training calculators and a calendar training plan. It is inspired by the resources available <a class="sneakylink" href="http://tuftsoarsmen.org">tuftsoarsmen.org</a>, but my site is mobile friendly and much easier to use. <br />
The site is an ongoing project. Please view the README file in <a href="https://github.com/fleetofthemalden/fleetofthemalden.com">my repo</a> to view the development timeline.
</p>

<p>
<a href="tictactoe/index.html">Tic Tac Toe (Squared)</a><br />
A new twist on the classic game of tic tac toe, intended for 2 players, requiring a much greater level of strategy than the original game.<br />
The rules can be found <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/06/26/tic-tac-toe-squared.html">here</a><br />
This independent project remains under development.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://minnick.co/comp20/frogger/index.html">Frogger</a> and 
<a href="http://minnick.co/comp20/frogger/pokemon/index.html">Pokemon Frogger</a><br />
A working version of the classic Frogger game created using javascript as part of a Web Programming assignment, and a version (still under development) using pokemon sprites.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://bikes.xvjpf.org/">WheelBorrowBikes</a> <a href="https://github.com/tuftsdev/comp20-team19">(github)</a> <br />
This collaborative effort was undertaken as a group-project for my Web Programming class (comp 20). 
This website serves as a functioning model for a bike-borrowing service.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://pacific-badlands-5369.herokuapp.com/">Messagehub (Rails app)</a><br />
A simple Ruby on Rails project for pushing and viewing messages. Described here in the <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebEngineering/assignments/a2.html">Assignment Guidelines</a>
A simple iOS app version has been created, description available <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebEngineering/assignments/a3.html">here</a></br>
To post: <pre> curl --data 'message[username]=Employer&message[content]=You're Hired&
message[app_id]=1' http://pacific-badlands-5369.herokuapp.com/messages.json </pre>

</p>

<p>More assignments are available in my Comp20 public <a href="https://github.com/fleetofthemalden/comp20">GitHub Repository</a>, as well as my <a href="https://github.com/tuftsdev/comp120-dminnick">Comp120 Repository</a></p>

<h2>Machine Instructions and Assembly Language (Comp 40)</h2>

<p>
Using the C Programming Language, we wrote a number of programs including:
<ul>
	<li>An abstract data type for polymorphic 2 dimensional arrays, including a representation for 2D blocked arrays</li>
	<li>A program which used these 2D arrays to remove black pixels from the edges of images</li>
	<li>A suite of operations able to compress, decompress and perform basic transformations on images</li>
	<li>A Universal Machine able to run basic programs using a limited instruction set</li>
	<li>An Assembler capable of taking in more complex instructions and emitting instructions for the Universal Machine</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We defused a "Binary Bomb" using a debugger when given only the Assembly language version of a program
</p>
<p>
Using Assembly Language we programmed a basic RPN calculator capable of addition, subtraction and division.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>
Type Checker<br />
During the course of my programming languages class (comp105), using ML, I implemented a type-checker for a subset of the Scheme programming language.
</p>
<p>
For Academic Integrity Reasons, I am unable to publish the solutions of these projects, but I am happy to show them to potential employers.
