<a href="http://fleetofthemalden.com">fleetofthemalden.com</a><br />
A simplified web interface intended primarily for mobile devices utilizing the resources of <a class="sneakylink" href="http://tuftsoarsmen.org">tuftsoarsmen.org</a> that allows rowers to access various erg workouts.
</p>
<p>
<a href="tictactoe/index.html">Tic Tac Toe (Squared)</a><br />
A new twist on the classic game of tic tac toe, intended for 2 players, requiring a much greater level of strategy than the original game.<br />
The rules can be found <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/06/26/tic-tac-toe-squared.html">here</a><br />
This project remains under development.

<h2>Machine Instructions and Assembly Language (Comp 40)</h2>

<p>
Using the C Programming Language, we wrote a number of programs including:
<ul>
	<li>An abstract data type for polymorphic 2 dimensional arrays, including a representation for 2D blocked arrays</li>
	<li>A program which used these 2D arrays to remove black pixels from the edges of images</li>
	<li>A suite of operations able to compress, decompress and perform basic transformations on images</li>
	<li>A Universal Machine able to run basic programs using a limited instruction set</li>
	<li>An Assembler capable of taking in more complex instructions and emitting instructions for the Universal Machine</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We defused a "Binary Bomb" using a debugger when given only the Assembly language version of a program
</p>
<p>
Using Assembly Language we programmed a basic RPN calculator capable of addition, subtraction and division.
</p>
<p>
For Academic Integrity Reasons, I am unable to publish the solutions of these projects, but I am happy to show them to potential employers.
