<h2>TicTacToe<sup>2</sup></h2>
<p>The Basic Idea: Which of the 9 boards you play on is determined by your opponent's
previous move. Likewise the board your opponent is permitted to play on is dependent on
the square you play in. For example, if you play in the center square, your opponent must
play his or her next move on the center board. In order to win the game, you must score
a tic tac toe by winning 3 of the individual 9 boards.
