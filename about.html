<p>I am currently a senior at Tufts University studying computer science. Presently I am seeking full-time employment post-graduation. When not studying, I work part-time as a programming intern for Acquire Media on their NewsEdge Software Dev Team as well as rowing the Tufts Varsity Crew Team during the fall and spring. Winters I race on the Tufts Alpine Ski team.</p>

<p>Originally from Boise Idaho, I came to Massachusetts to study at Tufts in 2011, and have spent the past few years exploring New England and the East Coast. When back in Idaho I enjoy many outdoor activities including backpacking, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting. I have traveled to 39 states and the District of Columbia as well as 16 foreign countries.</p>

<p>This site was created as an assignment for an introductoray Web Programming class in February 2012 using pure HTML and CSS without any frameworks or javascript. I keep the content up to date, but the layout remains original.</p>
