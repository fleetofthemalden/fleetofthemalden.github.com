<p>I was born and raised in Boise Idaho, graduating Boise High School in 2011. I effectively moved to Massachusetts later that year when I started Tufts University. I still visit Idaho sometimes because in few places on earth is there better access to so many outdoor recreational activities. I am an avid backpacker, kayaker, fly-fisherman and backcountry skier. Now that I live here in Massachusetts I row for the Tufts Crew Team and in the winter I race on the Tufts Ski Team. I am majoring in Computer Science and plan to graduate in 2015. I enjoy long bromantic walks on the beach with my roommate Ben.<p>
