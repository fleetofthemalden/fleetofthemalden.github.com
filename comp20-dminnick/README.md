Tufts University Comp 20

*) This repository contains the work for Comp 20 Web programming.
Basic aspects of the course include intoduction to HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,
JSON, Git, AJAX and JQuery.

*) My favorite project in this repository is the frogger assignment where we
created a working version of the game frogger. It challenged me to be creative
with my code and took quite a while to do.

*) Frogger is also the project I am most proud of, and I currently have a 
partially developed version that uses pokemon sprites instead of the usual
Frogger ones.

*) After taking this class, I now have a reasonable degree of proficiency in
the above referenced technologies. These are skills which are useful in the
industry and I am also much more interested in web programming as a discipline
and plan to pursue it further.
