___________________________________________

Part 1:

Collaboration:
I saw an example in the Apple documentation in which each sprite had its
own draw method, so I did the same.

Correctly implemented:
All parts of the assignment and more,
Draw Methods for ALL sprites
Draw method for game initialization
Draw method to display score

Not implemented:
All required parts are implemented.
There is a framework in place to support animation. It does not work.
There is a function to keep track of lives. It works on its own.

Time Spent: 7-14 hours, sorry I can't be more specific. I've been doing it
in bits and pieces.
